# Project Euler #2

```
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
```

## Solution

```ruby
Fibonacci.sum_evens(4_000_000)
# => 4613732
```

Also provides a `sum_where` method that accepts a block allowing you to specify which terms are valid to sum:

```ruby
Fibonacci.sum_where(60) { |el| el % 3 == 0 }
# => 24
# (3 + 21)
```
